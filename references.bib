  abstract = {Plastics are ubiquitously used by societies, but most of the plastic waste is deposited in landfills and in the natural environment. Their degradation into submillimetre fragments, called microplastics, is a growing concern due to potential adverse effects on the environment and human health. Microplastics are present in the air and may be inhaled by humans, but whether they have deleterious effects on the respiratory system remain unknown. In this study, we determined the presence of microplastics in human lung tissues obtained at autopsies. Polymeric particles (n~=~33) and fibres (n~=~4) were observed in 13 of 20 tissue samples. All polymeric particles were smaller than 5.5~{\textmu}m in size, and fibres ranged from 8.12 to 16.8~{\textmu}m. The most frequently determined polymers were polyethylene and polypropylene. Deleterious health outcomes may be related to the heterogeneous characteristics of these contaminants in the respiratory system following inhalation.},

MPs can enter the human body through the food chain and contaminated environment. Ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact are the routes of their entry into the human body. Recent studies reporting the detection of MPs within the human body have raised concern among the scientific community as the knowledge about human exposure is still very limited and their impact on health is not well-understood yet. In this review article, we briefly cover the reports evidencing MP detection within the human body, e.g., stool, placenta, lungs, liver, sputum, breast milk, and blood. A concise synopsis of sample preparation and analysis of such human matrices is also provided. This article also presents a summary of the effect of MPs on human cell lines and human health.},

  abstract = {The human genome contains more than 200,000 gene isoforms. However, different isoforms can be highly similar, and with an average length of 1.5kb remain difficult to study with short read sequencing. To systematically evaluate the ability to study the transcriptome at a resolution of individual isoforms we profiled 5 human cell lines with short read cDNA sequencing and Nanopore long read direct RNA, amplification-free direct cDNA, PCR-cDNA sequencing. The long read protocols showed a high level of consistency, with amplification-free RNA and cDNA sequencing being most similar. While short and long reads generated comparable gene expression estimates, they differed substantially for individual isoforms. We find that increased read length improves read-to-transcript assignment, identifies interactions between alternative promoters and splicing, enables the discovery of novel transcripts from repetitive regions, facilitates the quantification of full-length fusion isoforms and enables the simultaneous profiling of m6A RNA modifications when RNA is sequenced directly. Our study demonstrates the advantage of long read RNA sequencing and provides a comprehensive resource that will enable the development and benchmarking of computational methods for profiling complex transcriptional events at isoform-level resolution.},

  abstract = {Microplastics have been frequently detected in aquatic environments, and there are increasing concerns about potential effects on biota. In this study, zebrafish Danio rerio and nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were used as model organisms for microplastic exposure in freshwater pelagic (i.e. water column) and benthic (i.e. sediment) environments. We investigated the toxic effects of five common types of microplastics: polyamides (PA), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS) particles. Results showed no or low lethality in D. rerio after exposure for 10d at 0.001--10.0mgL-1 microplastics. The PA, PE, PP and/or PVC microplastics with {\textasciitilde}70{$\mu$}m size caused intestinal damage including cracking of villi and splitting of enterocytes. Exposure to 5.0mgm-2 microplastics for 2d significantly inhibited survival rates, body length and reproduction of C. elegans. Moreover, exposure to microplastics reduced calcium levels but increased expression of the glutathione S-transferase 4 enzyme in the intestine, which indicates intestinal damage and oxidative stress are major effects of microplastic exposure. Among 0.1, 1.0 and 5.0{$\mu$}m sizes of fluorescently labeled PS, 1.0{$\mu$}m particles caused the highest lethality, the maximum accumulation, the lowest Ca2+ level in the intestine and the highest expression of glutathione S-transferase 4 in nematodes. Taken together, these findings suggest that intestinal damage is a key effect of microplastics; and that the toxicity of microplastics is closely dependent on their size, rather than their composition.},

Thus, in this work we review the evidence for potential negative effects of microplastics in the human body, focusing on pathways of exposure and toxicity. Exposure may occur by ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact due to the presence of microplastics in products, foodstuff and air. In all biological systems, microplastic exposure may cause particle toxicity, with oxidative stress, inflammatory lesions and increased uptake or translocation. The inability of the immune system to remove synthetic particles may lead to chronic inflammation and increase risk of neoplasia. Furthermore, microplastics may release their constituents, adsorbed contaminants and pathogenic organisms. Nonetheless, knowledge on microplastic toxicity is still limited and largely influenced by exposure concentration, particle properties, adsorbed contaminants, tissues involved and individual susceptibility, requiring further research.},

  abstract = {Background: Presently, there is increasing public consciousness regarding the contamination and detection of microplastics (MPs) within the human body, and studies on the detection and characterization of MPs in human breast milk are limited. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of MPs found in human breast milk and examine the relationship between maternal hygiene practices, complications that may arise during breastfeeding, and the composition of the bacterial microbiota. Methods: Postpartum breast milk was analyzed for MPs using Raman micro-spectroscopy. The relationship between MP detection, maternal hygiene, breastfeeding complications, and bacterial microbiota was examined. In order to identify correlations and differences between groups that had detected and non-detected MPs, statistical analyses were performed, which involved demographic comparisons and correlation network analysis. Results: The mean age of the 59 postpartum women was 28.13 years. We found MPs in 38.98\% of breast milk samples (23 of 59), exhibiting diverse morphological and chemical characteristics. Most MP polymers were polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride. Maternal hygiene and breastfeeding complications differed between the MPs-detected and non-detected groups. Maternal behaviors may influence the presence of microplastics in breast milk, which were associated with these differences. Bacterial microbiota analysis revealed significant taxonomic differences between the MPs-detected and non-detected groups. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus dominated the MPs-detected group, while Enterobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter dominated the non-detected group. The MPs-detected group had a more even bacterial distribution, especially Bacteroides. Conclusions: This study found MPs in 38.98\% of breast milk samples using Raman micro-spectrometry, with PP, PE, and PVC being the most common. Significant differences in maternal hygiene and breastfeeding complications were found between the groups with and without MPs. Breast milk microbiota may be linked to MP detection. Further study should be conducted to identify the possible maternal-child health.},

Recently, third-generation/long-read methods appeared, which can produce genome assemblies of unprecedented quality. Moreover, these technologies can directly detect epigenetic modifications on native DNA and allow whole-transcript sequencing without the need for assembly.

The results showed that MPs were detected in both testis and semen, with an average abundance of 0.23~{\textpm}~0.45~particles/mL in semen and 11.60~{\textpm}~15.52~particles/g in testis. Microplastics in the testis were composed of polystyrene (PS) with 67.7~\%, while polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were the predominant polymers in semen. Compared to fragments, fiber, and film detected in semen, the fragment was the main shape the in testis. The sizes of these microplastics ranged from 21.76~{$\mu$}m to 286.71~{$\mu$}m, and most (67~\% and 80.6~\%) were 20--100~{$\mu$}m in semen and testis.

Related toxicological investigations of microplastics were gradually increased. To comprehensively illuminate the interplay of microplastic exposure and human health, we systematically reviewed the updated toxicological data of microplastics and summarized their mode of action, adverse effects, and toxic mechanisms. The emerging critical issues in the current toxicological investigations were proposed and discussed.
